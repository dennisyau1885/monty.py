A learning journey
- [X] Write some .py that returns a different line from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(Monty_Python) each time
- [X] Terraform a AWS DynamoDB table, use ttl so old entries get auto deleted
- [X] Integrate .py with AWS DynamoDB so it remembers what spam line it was on previously
- [ ] Ensure unittest.py is happy
- [ ] Package up .py for AWS Lambda
- [ ] deploy using github actions
